## About Application .

This applications is built with ReactJs . I have implemented react-redux which helps in maintaining the state of the components globally . 

User will have to choose the boarding point and the drop location from the dropdowns . If there are trains available inbetween those stations a list of trains will be displayed which will display the name of the train , boardpoint/droppoint , departure time / book option . When the user clicks on the book button , a modal will be displayed which will have the fair (1.25 rs/km) displayed .
